# MachineLearningAnalysis_Student_Performance

Education is a key factor in the development of social society. The study on improving education quality has never been stopped. Nowadays, with more structured data collected from students, a qualitative analysis using machine learning can give insights into the factors that have a strong influence on students' performance. In this repo, the _Student Performance Data Set[1]_ from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) is explored and analyzed using a few supervised machine learning algorithms.

This is a release of V1.0:
